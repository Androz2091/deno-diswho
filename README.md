# DisWho

[Deno](https://deno.land/) port of [Androz2091/diswho](https://github.com/Androz2091/diswho) featuring reCaptcha protection, JWT authentication and return URL.

## Usage

Login at `/`. If provided, `returnUrl` query param will be redirected to, with a `diswhoJwt` query param.

Then, make requests to `/user/{userId}` using `GET` method and `Bearer YOUR_JWT_HERE` as `authorization` header, which will directly return the untransformed response from `https://discord.com/api/v8/users/{userId}`.

**This API is useful for web applications so you can request this API instead of the Discord one (and therefore, you don't need your users to provide a discord bot token).**

## Installation

Run using the following command :

```bash
PORT=3050 CAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY="" CAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY="" DISCORD_SECRET="" deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read mod.js
```

Other optional parameters are `SESSION_DURATION` in milliseconds (`900000` by default i.e. 15 mins) and `JWT_SECRET` (auto-generated by default i.e. any restart will invalidate all active tokens).
